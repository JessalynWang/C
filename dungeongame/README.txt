The purpose of the lab was to create a game using file I/O. I think the purpose was to introduce and familiarize us with opening and
reading and closing files. I thought the most important aspect was learning how to use fopen(), fclose(), and the various fseek(), fread(),
and fgetc() functions. In addition, understanding how a system looks for the files we are trying to open and making sure they were
in the same directory were also important.

My approach to the lab. I first wrote the Player functions because I knew they were needed in Game.C. Then, I wrote a helper function to
open files as and store all of the what was read in the room struct with its appropriate members. I then wrote a very basic main that only
loaded the starting room to test that the file opening function worked. After bug testing that, I was pretty much done. The rest of the code
was pretty standard stuff, taking input in main and checking for correctness and reprompting. It was simple from there. Nothing went wrong,
and I thought the file stuff was pretty understandable and easy to learn. I enjoyed it and would apporach it the same way again.

The lab took about three to four hours in total. I think it went well and I was able to navigate the world without error. I liked the file I/O
aspect of the lab although I do think it was a bit simple, maybe because all the rooms were predesigned. It would have been cool to write
a storyline. The grading seems appropriate and the lab manual worked fine, although I do wish some sort of expected output was shown. If I were
to redesign the lab I would do the same thing, just make the game a bit more complex.
