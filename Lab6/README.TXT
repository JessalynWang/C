Summary: I think this lab was an introduction to the PIC32 and the features we will be using to program it. I thought
learning how to control the buttons and LEDs against the clock were important, as well as learning how to check when
a button or switch has been pressed. I think I am more familiar now with the PIC32 and how to program each part. I
also think learning about interrupts and debouncing was important.

My approach: I did each lab by part, from 1 - 5. I made sure to finish and understand each part before moving on. I
first read the manual and then if I thought some parts needed clarification I checked Piazza or read further into the
lab manual. It worked well and I didn't run into any major issues while doing the lab. I would not approach the lab
differently if I were to do it again.

Results: I my lab ended up going well and it is mostly correct. I ended up spending about six hours on it, as I'm new
to PIC32 and needed to learn the details of using it, though I did feel that the learnig curve was pretty acceptable.
Once I got into the rhythom of things I was able to finish the lab pretty quickly. I will say that the lab manual was
a bit unclear and there seemed to be some discrepancies between it and the example videos. I would add clarifications
to the lab, but otherwise would not change anything.
 
Because of clarification issues, I had to make some assumptions about the extra credit that I will list now: 
1. if one button is pressed and freezes/starts the LED movement, another simultaneous button press will not affect 
it. Priority is given to button one and button four is the least significant button. 
2. speed can be changed even while the LED is frozen.
